# Bare Bones Kernel

This project was started by following the osdev.org (Bare Bones)[https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones] tutorial.

I aim to learn about OS development through this, and this is not an attempt at making a useful kernel.

I used the GCC 13.2.0 toolchain from lordmilko's (repo)[https://github.com/lordmilko/i686-elf-tools/releases]
